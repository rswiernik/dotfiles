# Some background, when you disconnect from the ssh session that tmux was lauched from, the tmux
# state stays unchanged. When you reconnect, you have a different auth sock temp file that is used
# by the new ssh session. Since there isn't a good way to update this inside the sessions in tmux,
# we link the new sock location to a common location so that we can use that inside the tmux
# shells, preventing us from having to relaunch shells to be able to do things like clone a git repo

SOCK_LINK="${HOME}/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock"
# Bind the ssh auth socket to a known location so we can reuse it in tmux
